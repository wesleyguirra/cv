## Summary
Graduated in Systems Analysis, with background in Digital Marketing and Design of interfaces. I have solid knowledge of the digital processes that involve development and planning. I've worked as a `Tech Lead` for more than a year and focused on Developing soft skills, mainly skills related to people management. I work actively with Agile `SCRUM` methodology and I'm a fan of `CI/CD` trying to automatize everything. 

Commonly look-up for other things that can help me grow, studying business processes was one of them. `Writing some articles` (In portuguese) trying to help local community and create authority for myself as I'm focusing on becoming an MVP (Microsoft Valuable Professional). I consume a lot of content about lean methodology and I have a digital agency, small but enough to develop my business vision, which is fundamental for anyone who proposes to create solutions that are functional for people.
